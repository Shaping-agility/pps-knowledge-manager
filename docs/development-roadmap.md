# PPS Knowledge Manager - Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the iterative development approach for the PPS Knowledge Manager, focusing on learning-driven evolution and test-driven development.

## Iteration 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Establish local development environment and basic infrastructure

### Completed Tasks
1. **Supabase Local Setup** ✅
   - Installed and configured Supabase Docker container

   - Tested basic connectivity and operations
   - Documented setup process

2. **Project Structure Setup** ✅
   - Implemented 3-layer architecture foundation
   - Set up configuration management system
   - Created comprehensive test framework with pytest
   - Established logging and monitoring

3. **Test Infrastructure Refactoring** ✅
   - Simplified architecture to single database approach
   - Implemented script-based test state management (`dropEntities.sql`)
   - Removed complex schema/database isolation logic
   - Achieved clean separation between test and production code

### Success Criteria ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- [x] Supabase container running and accessible

   - Implement configurable chunking strategies

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Sentence transformer-based chunking operational
- [ ] Multiple chunking strategies available (standard + semantic)
- [ ] Chunk quality metrics implemented
- [ ] Configurable chunking pipeline

### Learning Goals
- Understand semantic chunking approaches and their benefits
- Identify optimal chunking strategies for different content types
- Learn about chunk quality evaluation methods
- Compare performance between standard and semantic approaches

## Iteration 5: Graph Storage Integration
**Goal**: Implement Neo4J integration with PPS Schema extensions

### Tasks
1. **Neo4J Setup**
   - Configure Neo4J Docker container
   - Implement PPS Schema with Person extensions
   - Create graph storage layer

## Iteration 6: Agent Tool Selection
**Goal**: Implement intelligent tool selection based on knowledge type

### Tasks
1. **Tool Selection Logic**
   - Implement knowledge type detection
   - Create tool selection algorithms
   - Build comparison and contrast capabilities

2. **Agent Integration**
   - Develop agent tools for knowledge access
   - Implement memory management tools
   - Create ingestion by attachment functionality

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agents can intelligently select knowledge tools
- [ ] Tool selection improves RAG performance

## Architecture Decisions & Patterns

### Test State Management
- **Approach**: Script-based reset using `dropEntities.sql`
- **Benefits**: Simple, explicit, easy to extend
- **Pattern**: Add DROP statements to `dropEntities.sql` for new test entities

### Database Architecture
- **Approach**: Single database with `public` schema
- **Benefits**: Simpler, more compatible with Supabase API
- **Pattern**: All operations use default database, no schema switching

### Connection Management
- **Approach**: Stateless connections with context managers
- **Benefits**: Prevents resource leaks, avoids import-time blocking
- **Pattern**: Use `SupabaseConnection` context manager for all operations

## Notes
- Each iteration should be completed before moving to the next
- Learning from each iteration should inform solution intent updates
- Focus on test-driven development throughout
- Document patterns for client reuse
